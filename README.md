# U.S.-COVID-Economic-Downturn-Effect-of-State-Sales-Tax-on-Employment-Recovery

This project was written in collaboration with Sibo Guo, Eustina Kim, Josh Kong, Ritesh Pendekanti, Cassandra Tai, and Wanxin Xie

On March 11th, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. Since then, the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted the U.S. economy greatly. We wanted to further explore how the em- ployment rate is changing by analyzing the relationship be- tween state sales tax and employment recovery. More specifi- cally, we are searching for any statistical evidence for the con- jecture that high state sales tax has resulted in slow employment recovery.
